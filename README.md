<h1>UniversityNotesManagementSystem</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
University Notes Management System(UNMS) was developed as our final year project for our bachelor's degree. It is a collaborative effort between me and my friend Abdul. UNMS is a web-based centralized platform for students to easily share and access academic notes. The platform addresses the lack of a common space for students to freely exchange notes, making learning more accessible and efficient.

<h2>Motivation</h2>

Notes play a crucial role in enhancing learning experiences and improving academic performance. However, at the time of my bachelor's, there was a noticeable absence of platforms exclusively dedicated to the free sharing of notes in our university. Our University Notes Management System bridges this gap by providing a unified platform for students to upload, access, and download notes seamlessly.
